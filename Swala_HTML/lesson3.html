    <p><u>Karim Benzema</u> is a former <u>Real Madrid</u> player who currently plays for <u>Al Hilal</u> in the <u>Saudi Pro League</u>.

He won 4 UCL titles with Real Madrid with his last UCL win giving him a clear shot at The Balon Dor in 2022. Though many called him out in his early days as a striker at Madrid during the BBC era, he shone when the duo of Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo moved to Tottenham and Juventus respectively. He came to terms with their departures and became a synical finisher with the assist stats to match.

        <img src="images/image4.jpg" alt="Cristiano Ronaldo">
        <p>Arguably one of the most decorated players of football history, Cristiano Ronaldo rose from humble beginnings in Madeira, Portugal where he played for Sporting Lisbon. His moment of reckoning came in 2002 after a friendly between Manchester United and Sporting Lisbon was played. He showed so much class from his ease of movement and vissionary ball carrying that the then Manchester United coach, Sir Alex Fergusson said that he would not leave the stadium until young Cristiano Ronaldo was signed to Manchester United and thus his story began. He produced season after season of astonishing performances at an even more alarming consistency that he was the most valuable player of the early 2010s. Ranging from goals from unthinkable distances, such as the iconic "Too far for Ronaldo to think about it" freekick to the wild knuckle ball freekick that gave rise to the puskas award. Not only was he a threat on the ground, but an arial one as well. This is shown by the fact that he has manged to score 156 arial goals so far in his career. That is more than most players will manage even after playing 15 year careers. Real Madrid saw this shining star and rushed to sign him in 2009 at a neck breaking 80 million pounds at that day and age. And he did not disappoint. Scoring 456 goals and gaining a mind boggling 157 assists at the same time, he did not just play, he dominated. His first big fete came in 2014 when Real Madrid won La Decima. This came after an apology in 2012 from him following missing a spot kick in the penalty shoot out against Bayern Munich. This coupled with both Sergio Ramos and Kaka missing their penalties as well, so Bayern proceed to the final where they ultimately lost to Chelsea in the penalty shootout. And his promise held strong, as he went on to bring Real Madrid back to back to back champions League trophies in what is commonly referred to as the 2 pete and Zinedine ZIdane. After this, he went on to sign for Juventus where he scored an unimaginable 105 goals for them in the Italian serie A. He also led them to winning the copa Italia twice back to back even though the squad dept could not facilitate them also winning a Champion's League. From here, he returned to Manchester United where he would grace European football one last time with performances such as the Hat trick against Tottenam and the one against Norwich city. An achievement that took 2 years to be achieved by any Manu United player. After a controversial take from the then Man United coach Eric Ten Hag, he proceeded to sign for Saudi club Al Nassrin 2023. This marked a major shift in the quality of players in Saudi Arabia and a friendly match with his ArchRival Lionel Messi that ended 6-0 went to show that the Saudi Pro League was a force to be reckoned with and this was confirmed in 2025 when ManchesterCity clashed with Al HIlal where they dramatically lost 3-2 to the Saudi giant. Internationally, he plays for Portugal and he has carried them to their only 3 international trophies to this day. A UEFA EURO and 2 Nation's League trophies. He is a 5 time Ballon Dor, Multiple time UEFA the Best player, POTS in the EPL, La LIga as well as Serie A.That together with his longevity has allowed him to prosper when most of the people he has played with have retired while </p>
