    <h2>Homeland</h2>
    <p>My only fear is corruption ending before I can benefit from it. Corruption is illegal, but if I am involved, I
        will defend it with my life. A wise man once said, "Now shut up as I dispense knowledge into your empty head".
        But we have good wildlife, they taste really good.</p>
    <h2>Townland</h2>
    <p>Nairobi is really nice, with its high octane activities, you can never lack something to keep you occupied, from
        the various malls, to the every once in a while concert, to the various hotels and not forgetting the thing that
        makes us to be the only city in the world with a national park, Nairobi National Park. This is why we are known
        as the city under the sun. Also not forgetting the large array of people from all over the country and the
        world, we form the largest social and economic hub in Kenya. However, like any other settlement, we have our
        fair share of struggles such as unemployment which gives rise to high crime rates, but I believe the good have
        out weighed the bad, and Nairobi is a land of infinite possibilities.</p>
    <h3>Cityland</h3>
    <p>Nairobi is arguably the backbone of the Kenyan economy, clearly evident since it generates the highest revenue of
        any county in Kenya. It is also a hub for various activities, including but not limited to, Conferences,
        summits, as well as employment.</p>
